\chapter{Experiment} \label{cpt-experiment}

To be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the given implementation, an in-depth 
experiment is conducted and evaluated. When considering the implementation, 


\section{Experimental Evaluation} \label{sec-experimental-evaluation}

To evaluate the key differences and the runtime performance in general, several aspects have to be considered.
Unfortunatly, comparing the occlusion culling implementation to an alternative implementation is not within the 
scope of this work, so efforts need to be made in order to evaluate the pipeline and its performance from a 
conceptual point of view and compared to the plain pipeline, without any occlusion culling at all. The next  
sections highlight the major aspects which are considered for the experiment and are evaluated during the 
test runs. All aspects aim to demonstrate how the occlusion culling affects the given test scene and how the 
computations differ compared to the plain pipeline. Later, use cases are considered which can be compared to 
alternative algorithms on a high level. However, keep in mind that it is up to future measurements to quantitavely
compare the pipeline to alternative approaches. 


\subsection*{Scene Layout}

First of, the scene layout and scene description need to be considered. Any occlusion culling algorithm somehow 
relies on spatial information, be it in world space, sceen space or by using a spatial container. Consequently, 
the scene layout and how the scene changes relative to the camera are important aspects to consider. For this 
experimental setup, a moving camera is used in order to test the ability of the occlusion culling algorithm to 
adapt to different angles of the scene. 

Another aspect to consider is the model data structure. The voxel models are volumetric representations and thus, 
not hollow. This leaves a large portion of computation to be irrelevant and allows for the occlusion culling to 
optimize the data flow. Different types of models are used to challenge the culling algorithm in different ways. 
In concept, the culling should be optimal on large, dense models with even faces. Consequently, models with 
slopes and holes are tested, to see how well best occluders can be computed. Smaller models might also pose a 
challenge for the optimization, especially when the octree nodes cannot be filled completely. Also, different 
voxle resolutions are used to achieve different amounts of octree nodes in the scene. All these different 
aspects should show the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm and how it can be optimally used in practice.


\subsection*{Timings}

Ultimately, the time spent for various computations is relevant for the selection of the best algorithm. This is 
a central tool to see how the implementation performs overall in the context of the framework used. The frame 
time is the first measurment to be considered, but not necessarily the most meaningful in a complex pipeline. 
Consequently, the timings for all major pipeline steps are considered, as well as the overall time spend on \ac{CPU} 
and \ac{GPU} computations.

When possible, compare timings to findings by \cite{Aaltonen2015} or \cite{Remedy2023}




\subsection*{Visibility and Culling}

In order to evaluate the general functionality and effectiveness of the pipeline, the voxel model is analysed 
with and without the occlusion culling applied. The amount of culled voxels is compared to the total amount of 
voxels resulting in an overview of how much geometry can be culled for different scene setups. The same is 
valid for the amount of octree nodes. They can also be compared to the amount of best occluders. The more best 
occluders present in a scene, the higher the probability to occlude other voxels or octree nodes. To evaluate 
how much can be optimized during the depth pre pass, the amount of best occluders can be compared to the amount 
of voxels representing the best occluders. Since the voxels are aggregated to larger cubes, drawing the inner 
volume of the voxel model is more efficient than drawing all the voxels individually. [@TODO: Make this sentance 
understandable]  
Finally, the actual amount of processed triangles shows the geometry processed by 
the \ac{GPU}.

\subsection*{Additional Overhead}

Ultimately, the additional overhead needs to be evaluated compared to the

\section{Measuring Tools}
[@TODO: Add quick sources for tools]
To measure timings and data precisely, a few external tools are used. All tools are part of the industry 
standard and can be evaluated as mostly reliable. Still, measuring performance usally comes with a minimal 
overhead which means that the results will most likely vary in precision. Also, some of the tools provide 
various ways of coming up with the data. Some data is measured while the profiled application is running, 
and other data is acquired by replaying the command list of the \ac{GPU}. Consequently, all measurements 
referring to one aspect of the application are compared against measurements using the same tool and 
configuration, if not explicitly specified otherwise. \\

\noindent
For the collection of data output, \emph{RenderDoc} is used. It is a free, MIT licensed rendering debugger,
widely used in the industy. [@TODO: Cite RenderDoc page]
For \emph{NVIDIA} specific \ac{GPU} profiling, \emph{NVIDIA NSight} is used, which is another industry standard 
profiling and debugging tool. It is only available for inspection of \emph{NVIDIA} graphics card computations but 
provides valuable insights into the rendering pipeline and hardware usage. 
The last tool used is \emph{Microsoft's PIX}, which is another performance debugging and profiling tool for 
\emph{Windows} platforms using \emph{Microsoft's DirectX} \ac{API}.


\section{Experimental Environment} \label{sec-experimental-environment}

For the experiment, different hardware setups are used to compare the runtime performance in different environments.
Some more modern hardware is used to profile the best case computations, and older hardware is used for comparison of 
different hardware features.

Note that the use of the Mesh Shading pipeline requires graphics cards that support the pipeline in the first place. 
For \emph{NVIDIA} \ac{GPU}s this is the \emph{Turing} lineup (\emph{NVIDIA RTX 20 series}) and for \emph{AMD} cards 
this would be the \emph{RDNA 2} lineup (\emph{AMD RX 6000 series}). \emph{Intel} \ac{GPU}s support the feature as 
well, starting from their first installment in the dedicated desktop \ac{GPU} series \emph{Intel Arc}. The specs of 
the test setups are listed in table \ref{tbl:hardware-setup}.
