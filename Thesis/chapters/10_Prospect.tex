\section{Future work}

- Use every thread in threadgroup and do not leave threadgroups idle when rejecting nodes (View Frustum Culling or frustum culling)
- Use Sparse Voxel DAGs and better data compression
- Use meshlet backface culling technique
- The construction of the \ac{HiZ}-pyramid can possibly be further optimized by computing values for all mip levels 
  in parallel, instead of sequentially writing and reading the values to or from a given mip level.
