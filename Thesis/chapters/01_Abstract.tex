The Hierarchical Z-Buffering algorithm recently gained popularity because of its ability to 
efficiently cull occluded geometry using a GPU-driven approach. This algorithm has not been 
available for voxel-based volumetric rendering in its original form. Here, a GPU-driven 
approach to Hierarchical Z-Buffering is presented, for use in voxel-based volumetric scenes 
by approximating the scene's volume with larger geometry. The approach uses an octree to 
efficiently schedule voxel data with respect to their spatial characteristics and replaces 
full octree nodes with larger geometry for fast computation of the Hierarchical Z-Buffer. 
This not only allows the application of Hierarchical Z-Buffering to a dynamic voxel scene, 
but also results in a performance increase compared to a rendering pipeline without occlusion 
culling. This work shows that the use of the modern mesh shading pipeline improves computations 
and leads to even better culling efficiency and overall performance.
