% @TODO: Meshlet Creation -> Voxel

- Meshlet creation for voxel meshes is trivial since meshlets don't have to be per-computed
- Meshlet culling is also straight forward since Voxels are inherently AABBs
- 

\section{Setup}

% @TODO: Add reference to Diligent Engine's github etc.
For the case study, a starting point is used which provides a reliable and comparable environment.
The framework used is the \emph{Diligen Engine} which already implements state of the art, multi-
platform and multi-API rendering. \\
