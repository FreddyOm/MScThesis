\chapter{Related Work} \label{cpt-related-work}

The approach we are proposing is a variation of a lot of ideas and implementations that have been 
around for quite some time. It is of great interest to explore related work which can provide 
context for usecases and additional techniques. Since our implementation is based on the areas 
of Voxel Redering, Occlusion Culling and Mesh Shading, this chapter will highlight related work 
for each of these topics. 


[@TODO: Check if per topic is viable here or if it feels redundant; otherwise structure per game]
