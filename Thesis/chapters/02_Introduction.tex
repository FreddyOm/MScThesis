\chapter{Introduction}










- Spektrum between CPU computation and GPU computation. 
CPU <-----------> GPU

- Mesh-Shading pipeline as new standard 

- Poses question, can mesh shading further optimize voxel rendering?

- Voxel Rendering

- Better geometry creation (in contrast to Geometry Shader)
- Optimized occlusion culling using per-meshlet OC
