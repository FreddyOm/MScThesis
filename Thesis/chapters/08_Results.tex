- Results of the case study


- Compare:
    - Model statically rendered without OC
    - Model statically rendered with OC
    - Model statically rendered with different OC implementation (?)
    
    - Model turntable rendered without OC

    - Model turntable rendered with different OC implementation (?)


- Criteria: 
    - Frame time
    - Dispatch numbers (?)
    - Duration of depth pre-pass
        - Draw best occluders to depth buffer
        - Duration of depth hierarchy creation
    - Visible cubes
    - Visible octree nodes
    - Amount of best occluders
    - CPU time
    - GPU time
    - Amount of overdraw (heatmap if possible)


- Model variations:
    - Lucy
    - Stanford Bunny
    - Torus (for when objects have "holes")
    - Some large, wide scenery
    - ...


- Machines:
