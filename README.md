The thesis LaTeX project for the master's thesis "Optimizing Voxel Rendering using a Mesh Shading Rendering Pipeline".


## Feedback Topics

- [ ] We or I in thesis text
- [ ] Show complete evolution of rendering or only the two compared pipelines
- [ ] Meshlet Culling algorithm in chapter 5 or 6? 


## Problems

- [ ] Shader invocation limit at 65536 -> Multiple Batches? -> Not a problem after occlusion culling?
- [ ] Lighting? Texturing? Normals?
