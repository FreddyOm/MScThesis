\chapter{Discussion} \label{cpt-discussion}

The following chapter discusses possible advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach based on 
the data presented in chapter \ref{cpt-experiment}. The results are revisited and summarized before they 
are interpreted and evaluated. In this context, other occlusion culling algorithms can be considered for 
qualitative comparison to this approach, although a final comparison would require quantitative data to 
support any assumptions. Finally, limitations of the approach are presented and discussed. [@TODO: Are other OC algos considered?]

\section{Summary of the Results}

The experiment tested the ability of the \ac{TPOC} to be adapted to a new use case. Traditionally, the algorithm 
couldn't be applied as is, since it relies on preprocessing large objects that are usually artist-picked. This 
approach was generally used in applications that make use of triangle meshes with only a boundary representation. 
This way, a lot of small objects can be occluded by one large occluder. \\

\noindent
This approach was adapted to fit the different circumstances found in volumetric voxel representations. The 
uniform size of voxels made this approach rather inefficient in practice. This problem was shown to be 
tackled by aggregating neighboring voxels to larger primitives, consequently decreasing computation time 
of the depth prepass. This approach also shifted the use of the algorithm slightly. Traditionally, \ac{TPOC} 
draws a handful of the best occluders to enable culling of other meshes. In the approach proposed in this work, 
the best occluders are part of the occluded model, and the geometry contributing to their creation may 
itself be occluded. \\

\noindent
Overall, the experiment showed that the \ac{TPOC} algorithm can be adapted to a volumetric voxel representation 
using two different configurations: the per-octree node culling and the per-meshlet culling. Both configurations 
were able to occlude a considerable amount of voxels while using a minimal amount of \ac{GPU} bandwidth. The 
per-meshlet culling was able to cull more octree nodes and, consequently, more voxels than the per-octree node 
culling. \\

\noindent
The \ac{CPU} times were found to be rather static, although both testing setups were not significantly reliant 
on \ac{CPU} computations due to their \ac{GPU}-driven nature. However, the \ac{GPU} measurements were significantly 
in favor of the per-meshlet occlusion culling configuration, which overall increased performance by $29.86\%$ on 
average. \\

\noindent
The overdraw measurements showed varying overdraw values for both configurations, which resulted in a similar amount 
of overdraw in the best case. In the worst case, the per-meshlet culling generally resulted in lower overdraw than 
the per-octree node culling. The amount of overdraw reached up to a maximum of about 90 draws to one pixel for 
per-octree culling and up to about 70 draws to one pixel for per-meshlet culling. It strongly correlated to the 
camera angle and was considerably high in both configurations. \\ 

\noindent
The type of mesh used in the scene had a significant influence on both the culling efficiency and the computation time.
Large, dense models were generally favored and resulted in a high best occluder count. In contrast, curved edges or 
surfaces resulted in a low octree node occupation, which in turn led to high overdraw. Thin and detailed geometry or 
models featuring a lot of holes and empty space in them were rather inefficient in computation. They generally resulted 
in a lack of full octree nodes and therefore in a lower best occluder count and octree node occupation. Such models 
were found to be very sensitive to different camera angles and could not cull voxels as efficiently compared to the 
other models tested. Still, they would benefit from the culling algorithm in both configurations.

\section{Interpretation of the Results}

This work aimed to test if the \ac{TPOC} algorithm could be applied to voxel rendering by adopting a good approximation 
for the creation of the best occluders and if the use of the Mesh Shading pipeline would optimize the performance and 
the amount of culled voxels. The presented results indicate that this was successful. Nevertheless, the results also 
provide more in-depth insights that are discussed below. \\

\noindent
First of all, the results need to be considered in the correct context. This approach was tested with a particular use case 
in mind. The main constraint is the volumetric nature of the scene, which is essential for this algorithm to make sense in 
the first place. For non-volumetric representations, other occlusion culling algorithms might be better suited, or the 
selection of the best occluders would fall back to whole models instead of parts of a volumetric model, like in this work's 
implementation. Another constraint is the rasterized rendering pipeline, since the occlusion algorithm cannot be applied to 
raytraced rendering. If both of these essential requirements are satisfied, the proposed approach can be adopted, and the 
presented results can be used as a benchmark in terms of performance and culling results. \\

\noindent
The main factors to influence the resulting performance and the culling efficiency are the models and their voxel resolution.
In general, large bodies can be approximated better than small or thin bodies. Models featuring small and thin details, holes, 
or large areas without geometry are harder to approximate. The higher the number of best occluders, the more likely it is 
that a lot of voxels are going to be culled in any given moment. \\

\noindent
But there are more nuanced relationships between the scene data and the performance. The \ac{CPU} measurements found that this 
specific setup does not have a significant impact on \ac{CPU} times due to its \ac{GPU}-driven nature. The \ac{GPU} performance 
considerably scaled with the amount of occluded voxels and, consequently, with the amount of visible voxels. The depth prepass 
scaled with the amount of best occluders that were drawn to the depth buffer, while the \ac{HiZ} creation wasn't shown to be scaling 
in the experiment, using a fixed screen resolution. Since in general, the \ac{HiZ} is the same for any given scene with the same 
screen resolution, it should only be impacted by a change of the screen resolution. This assumption is strongly supported by the 
way the \ac{HiZ} creation is implemented. Consequently, the final performance of both tested configurations is expected to vary 
based on the amount of completely filled octree nodes. \\

\noindent [@TODO: Add graph which plots culling efficiency against total voxel count]
The data indicates that a higher average occupation has the tendency to result in better overall culling performance and subsequently 
in better \ac{GPU} performance as well. It can also be derived that the average culling efficiency increases with the increase of 
voxels in the scene. But this is only true to an extent, since the \emph{Hairball} model showed a decrease in average culling efficiency 
compared to the \emph{Lucy} model while having almost 5 times the voxel count. This tendency is therefore only visible for models 
that are similarly dense in structure and do not contain holes or other challenging features.\\

\noindent
The general approximation of best occluders did work well for most of the models. However, the \emph{Hairball} model showed that specific 
features posed a challenge for the algorithm. The approximation of a model's volume by aggregating voxels together is only possible for 
models that provide dense volumes in the first place. The systematic testing of a challenging model provided valuable insights into the 
limitations of the approach. Consequently, the algorithm is expected to not be very beneficial when using it in scenes with small, thin 
details or holes.\\




%\noindent [@TODO: Consider moving this to technical background or something like this]
%The fact that the approach uses screen space visibility testing results in a general purpose culling algorithm. Although there are use cases 
%in which the approach works better than in others, there is limitation to where it can be applied. Consider another occlusion culling algorithm 
%that uses bouding boxes to approximate object boundaries. Such an algorithm would check for visibility using the bounding volumes. If one of the 
%objects were a wall with a window in it, this could not be reliably computed because of the hole in the wall. Another technique would have to 
%be used here in order to test for visibility using the \\

\noindent
The \ac{TPOC} algorithm usually uses a handful of occluders to cull other occludees. So normally, there is no overlap between occluders and 
occludees. However, this work's approach uses a slightly different way of working with occluders and occludees. Because of their volumetric 
nature, the models can self-occlude, which means that the approximated volume can be used as an occluder to cull a vast amount of voxels that 
make up the volume itself. This is a slightly different perspective on the \ac{TPOC} algorithm and makes it possible to use the approach when 
there is only one model present. \\

\noindent
The per-meshlet culling configuration proved to be more efficient due to a more precise culling of voxels, even partially culling octree nodes.
In this sense, the Mesh Shading pipeline featured a higher culling ratio and superior occlusion culling in general. Another aspect to consider 
is the possibility of optimizing the \ac{HZB} algorithm further. Traditionally, when comparing a bounding box to the \ac{HiZ} pyramid, all depth 
values of the \ac{HiZ} pyramid within the minimum and maximum bounds need to be checked against the minimum z value of the object in question.
This is where the hierarchy optimizes the process because with each mip level, a texel covers a greater section of the depth buffer, making 
sampling the \ac{HiZ} pyramid cheaper in terms of computation time. Since cubical voxels are easily defined by their min and max values and 
there is no sub-voxel detail, this process can potentially be optimized further. When using per-meshlet culling, each voxel's bounds are 
checked individually, and theoretically, no hierarchy is necessary. This assumption was formed by this work's implementation, since it only used 
the full-resolution depth buffer for the \ac{HZB} due to visual errors that couldn't be fixed in time. That way, only one sampling per screen 
rectangle corner is necessary, either per mip level, or only using the full resolution z-buffer. If this assumption holds true and can be 
generally confirmed, the computation of the prepass would reduce to only the depth pass, without the need to compute a hierarchy. \\

\noindent
No matter how the prepass is executed, the measurements show that the highly parallelized way of computing the occlusion test does not lead to 
the per-meshlet culling being slower than the per-octree culling. This can be explained by the massive amount of parallelization that is 
possible in modern hardware and how the more fine-grained culling removes more geometry than the per-octree node culling does. This in turn leads 
to a lower dispatch count of Mesh Shaders and subsequently to a lower load on rasterizer and Pixel Shader computations. However, this relation 
is expected to be only valid for a reasonable amount of dispatches by the Task Shader, since a higher amount could ultimately lead to an inefficient 
usage of \ac{GPU} threads. \\

\noindent
The \ac{GPU}-driven approach moves most of the computations for the occlusion culling to the \ac{GPU}, leaving more \ac{CPU} cycles for different 
computations, like updating the voxel data dynamically. When using the approach with suitable scenes and geometry, this algorithm might be able 
to optimize volumetric voxel rendering further. Particularly if the proposed implementation is even further optimized to fit the given use case, 
for example, by using command lists to avoid a write-back to \ac{CPU} memory before dispatching the meshes for the final draw call. \\

%- Main Constraints

%- Models, resolutions and Scaling of individual parts of the pipeline (which are static, which scale with the pixel res, which scale with voxel count, ...)

%- Approximate best occluders for prepass




%- Advantage of algo using screen space (vgl. window scene)

%- Perspective: Culling best occluder with "itself"

%- Confirmed sub-model culling using mesh shading 
%- Per-Meshlet culling has no sub-meshlet detail, only 4 checks are necessary for accurate occlusion checks -> could be possible to omit HiZ pyramid

%- Highly parallel way of scheduling mesh data makes this possible and not significantly slower than culling complete octree nodes (as long as node count is reasonably low)

%- On-chip creation of voxels leaves room for different CPU computations and Occlusion culling can be implemented in suitable scenes while moving occlusion culling computations almost entirely to the GPU

\section{Limitations}

The experiment also featured some limitations that are essential to consider for further research of the approach.



[@TODO: Mention that experiment was limited by directly using the highest resolution z buffer in cpt experiment!]
[@TODO: Where do I write about the scaling of computation times with screen res / voxel count / ...?]




%
%- Pro: 
%    - No meshlet precomputation, since meshlets are created on the GPU
%    - Meshlet voxels are inherently AABBs which is quite helpful for intense intersection computations % @TODO: Check if there are even any intersection comps to be done
%    - Cores of most models can be "removed"
%    - New possibility of using occluders for occlusoin of the same "mesh"
%    - PMOC allows for only 4 checks to be made, since if voxels are meshlets, subvoxel detail doesn't exist. 
%- Con:
%    - Depending on the voxel size, there might be a need for chunking the data effectively % @TODO: Check if this is still necessary with Meshlet Occlusion Culling enabled
%    - Voxels as meshlets -> non-similar normals can be inefficient.. 
%    - Note that the amount of threads used per group is equal to the amount of voxels within the repsective octree 
%    node, leaving a significant amount of threads unused for scarcely populated octree nodes.
%    - Memory bandwidth between CPU and GPU is not really changed. Only the scheduling of the draw calls is optimized.
%    Works fine in practice but is very use case sensitive.
%    - Doing this for all models present will scale the prepass with the amount of best occluders / models -> Chunking to only have a handful of models / best occluders around 
%    - Consoderable overdraw
%
%Discussion points:
%
%- When already drawing aggregated bounding boxes, isn't this just HiZ Buffering? And is it then better to draw everything
% to test for visibility instead of only best occluders?
