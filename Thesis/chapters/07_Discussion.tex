\chapter{Discussion} \label{cpt-discussion}


- Pro: 
    - No meshlet precomputation, since meshlets are created on the GPU
    - Meshlet voxels are inherently AABBs which is quite helpful for intense intersection computations % @TODO: Check if there are even any intersection comps to be done
    - Cores of most models can be "removed"
    - New possibility of using occluders for occlusoin of the same "mesh"
- Con:
    - Depending on the voxel size, there might be a need for chunking the data effectively % @TODO: Check if this is still necessary with Meshlet Occlusion Culling enabled
    - Voxels as meshlets -> non-similar normals can be inefficient.. 
    - Note that the amount of threads used per group is equal to the amount of voxels within the repsective octree 
    node, leaving a significant amount of threads unused for scarcely populated octree nodes.


Discussion points:

- When already drawing aggregated bounding boxes, isn't this just HiZ Buffering? And is it then better to draw everything
 to test for visibility instead of only best occluders?
