\chapter{Discussion}


- Pro: 
    - No meshlet precomputation, since meshlets are created on the GPU
    - Meshlet voxels are inherently AABBs which is quite helpful for intense intersection computations % @TODO: Check if there are even any intersection comps to be done

- Con:
    - Depending on the voxel size, there might be a need for chunking the data effectively % @TODO: Check if this is still necessary with Meshlet Occlusion Culling enabled
