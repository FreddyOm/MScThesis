\begin{abstract}
    We present \ac{TPOC} for dynamic voxel scenes based on \ac{HZB}, which is a \ac{GPU}-driven 
    approach to \ac{HZB} that uses larger geometry as an approximation of the scene's volume. 
    The \ac{HZB} algorithm has recently gained popularity due to its ability to efficiently cull 
    occluded geometry using a \ac{GPU}-driven approach. This algorithm has not been available in 
    its original form for dynamic voxel-based scenes. The approach uses an octree to efficiently 
    schedule voxel data with respect to their spatial characteristics and replaces full octree nodes 
    with larger geometry for fast computation of the \ac{HZB}. This not only allows the application 
    of \ac{HZB} to a dynamic voxel scene, but also results in increased performance compared to a 
    rendering pipeline without occlusion culling. We show that the use of the mesh shading pipeline 
    in combination with a \ac{SVO} can adapt the \ac{HZB} to efficiently occlude a significant number 
    of voxels, which results in an overall performance increase. The term volumetric voxel scene 
    refers to a scene that not only approximates the surface by using voxels but also includes a 
    voxel-based volume that might be exposed or altered during runtime. A great amount of the 
    algorithm relies on \ac{GPU}-driven computations, which allow for millions of voxels to be 
    drawn efficiently.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent
Real-time voxel rendering usually has two distinct fields of application: real-time 
raytracing and the traditional rasterized rendering approach. While the former is 
popular due to the uniform nature of voxels and the ability to easily cast rays using 
a regular voxel grid, the latter has been used in real-time applications for volumetric 
representations of scenes and simple physics or similar dynamic interactions. \\

\noindent
Over the last decades, ray tracing has been subject to a lot of innovation, especially in  
real-time applications for entertainment purposes, i.e., games. Hardware manufacturers have 
been adding more support for specific raytracing compute units, and the software side of 
GPUs has been upgraded to support features like ray-traced ambient occlusion, shadows, 
and global illumination. However, the rasterized approach to voxel rendering hasn't been 
very present in the entertainment industry, although the rasterized rendering pipeline has 
been upgraded significantly over the last decade. A central overhaul is the mesh shading 
pipeline, which has been introduced to \ac{GPU}s in 2018. It features a new way of preprocessing 
vertices using a more general compute architecture, which allows for more efficient \ac{GPU} 
computations. \\

\noindent
Recent games made use of \ac{HZB} in combination with the mesh shading pipeline to efficiently 
cull mesh instances and even invisible parts of meshes. While the original algorithm by Greene 
et al. \cite{b1} was intended to be used on the \ac{CPU}, modern applications of \ac{HZB} are implemented 
as \ac{GPU}-driven occlusion culling techniques, which have been a driving factor for the recent increase 
in geometrical density. The approach is heavily reliant on the presence of large, static occluder 
geometry, which makes it inefficient to be used in voxelized scenes in the form it has been so far. \\

\noindent
In this paper, we present a technique to dynamically approximate volumetric voxel scenes, and show 
that the use of the mesh shading pipeline in combination with a \ac{SVO} can adapt the \ac{HZB} to 
efficiently occlude a significant number of voxels, which results in an overall performance increase.
The term volumetric voxel scene refers to a scene that not only approximates the surface by using 
voxels but also includes a voxel-based volume that might be exposed or altered during runtime. 
A great amount of the algorithm relies on \ac{GPU}-driven computations, which allow for millions of 
voxels to be drawn efficiently. \\

\noindent
Our technique is based on the assumption that a vast amount of voxels within and behind a given 
part of the scene is occluded by some other voxels in the same scene. The technique approximates 
the non-visible volume within a voxel scene and uses it as an occluder for \ac{GPU}-based \ac{HZB}. 
We have implemented and tested the algorithm in two different configurations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \ac{PONOC} using a mesh shading pipeline
    \item \ac{PMOC} using a mesh shading pipeline
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Voxel Scene Representations} \label{subsec-voxel-scn-rep}

\noindent
Laine and Karras \cite{b6} analyze and implement a variation of the base Sparse Voxel Octree
approach for efficiently ray tracing voxel models. In their work, contours are used to
approximate octree nodes within a \ac{SVO}. If the octree node is found
to be approximated good enough, the subdivision to deeper levels in the octree node is
terminated. This way, \ac{SVO}s can be significantly reduced in size, which benefits the memory 
footprint of the application and aims to increase real-time raytracing performance. \\

\noindent
Kämpe et al. \cite{b2} propose the use of their high-resolution sparse voxel \ac{DAG}. 
This approach is tailored to high voxel resolutions and data that might not fit into 
memory all at once. Their data structure can be easily split up into several subtrees, 
which in turn can be loaded individually. This approach seems promising for large scenes 
and use cases, which require the streaming of data. They propose to structure the data in 
a way that enables equal nodes of an octree hierarchy to be reduced to only one instance, 
eliminating redundant parts of the hierarchy and reducing the amount of used memory immensely.

\subsection{Occlusion Culling} \label{subsec-occlusion-culling}

\noindent
Greene et al. \cite{b1} proposed the first \ac{HZB} algorithm with the capability to use 
screen space data to cull meshes in large and densely populated scenes. The idea originated 
in the context of a forward-rendered pipeline, making use of the \ac{CPU} for culling instances. 
They propose to use a spatial container like an octree to enable drawing the scene in a rough 
front-to-back order. Each mesh is individually drawn to a depth buffer resource, starting with 
an empty one in the beginning and populating it as more meshes are drawn. The buffer resource 
also maintains a mip chain that is updated when the full-resolution depth buffer is updated. 
Each time a mesh is rendered to the depth buffer, it is checked against the depth hierarchy, 
starting with the coarsest mip level. This way, near and big objects are likely to occlude small, 
far objects, resulting in an efficient way to reject invisible meshes. \\

\noindent
Hasselgren et al. \cite{b3} present a novel way of implementing occlusion culling relying on hardware 
occlusion queries while optimizing the queries using \ac{CPU} \ac{SIMD} acceleration. The basic algorithm 
is very similar to common \ac{CPU}- or \ac{GPU}-computed \ac{HZB}, with two major alterations to the implementation. 
First, they make use of Intel's \ac{AVX} to compute depth values for tiles of 256 texels in parallel. 
The second difference is the way they store depth and coverage data. In contrast to a "traditional" 
\ac{HZB} mip-chain, Hasselgren et al. decouple depth and coverage data by storing a coverage mask for 
$32 \times 8$ pixel tiles, which can be efficiently computed by using the \ac{AVX} of Intel \ac{CPU}s. In 
their results, they show that their implementation is up to 3 times faster than previous occlusion 
culling algorithms while also providing a lower memory footprint. \\

\noindent
Aaltonen et al. \cite{b4} present a \ac{GPU}-driven technique involving both \ac{HZB} and depth reprojection. 
Both make for a good occlusion culling technique in games with large occluders or interiors. First, 
artist-picked best occluders are drawn to the depth buffer in a depth pre-pass. Then, projected bounding
boxes can be used to test the visibility of smaller objects in the scene. A hierarchical z-buffer is 
used to accelerate this testing, as proposed by Greene et al. \cite{b1}. Finally, the depth buffer of 
the last frame can be reprojected to further minimize computations. This technique allows developers 
to push for huge draw distances and densely crowded environments.

\section{Hierarchical Z-Buffering} \label{sec-hierarchical-z-buffering}

\noindent
In the past, the \ac{HZB} algorithm proposed by Greene et al. \cite{b1} has been slightly 
adapted for use on the \ac{GPU}. During the rendering routine, a small set of best occluders is 
drawn to the depth buffer during a depth prepass, without invoking the pixel shader. This 
depth information is subsequently converted into a \ac{HZB} pyramid, which is a mip chain 
containing the depth information for increasingly large parts of the screen space per texel. \\

\noindent
In the final color pass, a bounding box is computed for each mesh instance, which in turn is used 
to sample the depth values stored in the \ac{HZB} pyramid. This depth information is taken into 
account for a conservative visibility check, and non-visible instances are omitted, while visible 
instances are being drawn.

\section{Data Management} \label{sec-data-management}

\noindent
Our approach uses a point cloud generated by voxelizing triangle meshes based on the work of \cite{b5}. 
The point cloud is stored as a position list, consumable by the \ac{GPU}. A second data structure is 
necessary for spatial computation, so voxels can be efficiently approximated by larger geometry. 
We chose a custom \ac{SVO} implementation that can easily be transferred to the \ac{GPU}. \\

\noindent
The data structures are bound to the \ac{GPU} pipeline and can be updated as needed. Updating the scene data 
involves updating the voxel list and recomputing the best occluders. Recurring real-time updates to the 
scene were not part of our measurements.

\section{Generating Best Occluders} \label{sec-gen-best-occluders}

\noindent
Traditionally, the best occluders are artist-authored meshes, which are expected to be occluding a lot 
of small instances during runtime. This can, for example, be a house, a large wall, or similar large 
geometry. Rendering them during a depth prepass enables the occlusion of smaller mesh instances. \\

\noindent
In voxel rendering, this is not applicable as is, since the individual meshes, i.e., the voxels, are all 
of uniform size. Additionally, the best occluders might need to be altered during runtime, since 
volumetric voxel representations often allow run-time manipulation of the voxel data. A predetermination 
of the best occluders is thus not possible as it is for static, non-voxel triangle meshes. \\

\noindent   % @TODO: Check sentence "even though the measurements did not include ..."
We have implemented a dynamic way of selecting the best occluder geometry for the depth prepass, even 
though the measurements did not include a runtime alternation of the voxel data. To select appropriate 
occluders, a buffer of octree nodes is used, which contains a list of the best occluders within the scene. \\

\noindent
To compute a best occluder, the property of a full node is recursively propagated upwards within the hierarchy, 
so the largest possible octree node, which is completely filled with voxels is used as an approximation for 
all the contained voxels. All best occluder nodes are then added to a buffer that can be sent to the \ac{GPU} for 
use in the depth prepass. \\

\noindent
In case of an alternation of the voxel data, the octree and the buffer need to be updated to reflect the 
new geometrical layout for the next frame. We show that querying the octree for the best occluders can be done 
within a reasonable time, although a final evaluation remains a subject for future research. \\

\noindent
Ultimately, the best occluders exchange a large amount of voxels with larger, octree node-sized boxes for 
computing the depth prepass. This way, drawing geometry to approximate the volume of the voxel scene is 
more efficient because of the reduced number of meshes contributing to the prepass. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:best-occluder-selection} shows a visualization featuring the best occluders in relation 
to the final voxel scene.

    \caption{The bunny model silhouette in black and the best occluders selected for the prepass in green.
    Instead of about 3 million voxels, only 8256 best occluders need to be drawn to approximate its volume.}
    \label{fig:best-occluder-selection}
\end{figure}

\section{Depth Prepass} \label{sec-depth-prepass}

\noindent
The frame's computation starts by computing the depth prepass, which is the custom
render pass central to the occlusion culling. In this pass, a compute shader is invoked
that takes the best occluders and draws them to the depth buffer. This depth pass does
not draw to the back buffer, making the computation relatively efficient. \\

\noindent
After the depth buffer is created, it is used to create a mip chain containing the depth 
data from the depth buffer, the \ac{HZB} pyramid. To create the mip chain, the full-resolution 
depth buffer is processed by a compute shader, which calculates the farthest depth value out 
of four texels and outputs it to the next higher mip level. The resulting mip chain consequently 
contains a coverage of differently sized screen-space quads with the respective farthest depth 
value. The mip chain is subsequently used in the task shader (amplification shader) during the 
occlusion culling. Fig.~\ref{fig:hzb-pyramid-viz} shows an exemplary \ac{HZB} pyramid.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/hiz-pyramid.png}
    \caption{The \ac{HZB} pyramid of the \emph{Bunny} scene.}
    \label{fig:hzb-pyramid-viz}
\end{figure}

\section{Occlusion Culling} \label{sec-occlusion-culling}

\noindent
For the main rendering pass, we propose generating the voxels directly on the \ac{GPU}, since this 
guarantuees fast processing of geometry and allows to create meshlets without precomputation.
Consequently, our implementation treats each voxel as one meshlet. \\

\noindent
When the voxels are scheduled for final rendering, the task shader precomputes the point cloud 
and only dispatches the voxels for a final draw if they are not found to be occluded. The occlusion 
culling is implemented similarly to other comparable approaches. First, bounding boxes are created 
around each point of the point cloud, which are then projected to screen space. After that, 
a two-dimensional screen-space rectangle is constructed around the bounding box using the minimum 
and maximum values on the \emph{y} and \emph{z} axes. Additionally, the minimum \emph{z} value of 
the bounding box is computed and stored alongside the \emph{y} and \emph{z} values. Using these 
coordinates, the four corners of the bounding boxes are sampled from the \ac{HZB} pyramid, and the 
resulting depth values are compared against the minimum \emph{z} value. If either of the 
\ac{HZB} pyramid samples is further away from the camera than the minimum \emph{z} value, the current 
voxel might be completely or partially visible. Conversely, as long as all samples are nearer to 
the camera than the minimum \emph{z} value, the voxel can safely be assumed to be occluded. This 
sampling starts using the highest mip level and continues down the mip chain until the voxel is 
found to be fully occluded or until the hierarchy is fully traversed and the voxel is found to be 
visible.

\end{figure*}

\section{Evaluation} \label{sec-evaluation}

\noindent
The primary experimental setup tested per-meshlet occlusion culling and compared it to per-octree node 
occlusion culling, which works similarly to the culling procedure outlined above but uses whole octree 
nodes instead of individual meshlets for the culling. In our implementation, the per-octree occlusion 
culling configuration had some visual errors, which were fixed to a great extent by directly using the 
full resolution depth buffer for sampling. However, this change was applied to both configurations, 
which made the pipelines comparable again.\\

\noindent
We will evaluate the two occlusion culling configurations (per-octree node and per-meshlet) with respect 
to culling efficiency, \ac{CPU} runtime performance, \ac{GPU} runtime performance, and pixel overdraw. We use five 
test scenes featuring different geometrical characteristics, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:models}. 


\subsection{Best Occluder Selection} \label{subsec-best-occluder-selection}

\noindent
The time spent on querying the best occluders within the octree is relevant for dynamically updating 
voxel data in real time. It is in general dependent on two main factors: the amount of octree nodes 
and the scene's spatial characteristics. \\

\noindent
The more nodes there are, the longer it typically takes to compute the best occluders, as the tree 
hierarchy becomes larger. However, in large scenes without gaps, this scaling effect is mitigated 
by the depth of the tree traversal. In this case the query can exit a subbranch of the octree 
earlier because a larger octree node might already approximate a large part of the volume sufficiently. \\

\noindent
The time measured for the best occluder selection is listed in Table \ref{tab:best-occluder-query}. 
All measured scenes had a dimension of $256^3$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Measurements of best occluder query.}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Best Occluder Selection - $256^3$}} \\
            \cline{2-4} 
            \textbf{Scene} & \textbf{\textit{Voxel Count}}& \textbf{\textit{Best Occluder Count}}& \textbf{\textit{Time (ms)}} \\
            \hline
            Lucy        & 331,254   & 1600 & 0.317 \\
            Bunny       & 3,379,738 & 8256 & 3.752 \\
            Torus       & 2,311,006 & 7168 & 2.681 \\
            Terrain     & 953,362   & 6976 & 1.267 \\
            Hairball    & 1,652,435 & 5056 & 2.377 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:best-occluder-query}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent
The measurements show the scaling of the computation time with the amount of best occluders. The \emph{Hairball} 
scene additionally shows a worse performance when compared to the \emph{Terrain}, although the terrain has more 
best occluders. This indicates that the quality of the scene in respect to its layout characteristics affects the 
amount of best occluders and ultimately the time spent on the selection query.\\

\noindent
The results suggest that the query can be used in realtime applications, as most of the measurements stay 
within reasonable time budgets for computation, if 16.6 ms is used as a reference time for one frame. However, 
the measurements were executed on a single thread, and the computation was not optimized thoroughly. The 
duration is expected to be optimized further by chunking the data to limit the size and the amount of octree 
nodes, as well as by applying multi-threaded computations, e.g., computing each chunk in parallel on the \ac{CPU}.

\subsection{Culling Efficiency} \label{subsec-culling-efficiency}

            Terrain     &  557,134      & $58.4 \%$    & 772,922        & $81.1 \%$     \\
            Hairball    &  954,886      & $57.8 \%$    & 1,070,722      & $64.8 \%$     \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:culling-efficiency}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent
Table \ref{tab:culling-efficiency} shows the average culling efficiency for each tested scene measured using 
different camera angles. The table indicates an overall better culling performance when using the per-meshlet 
occlusion culling as compared to the per-octree culling configuration. The per-meshlet configuration culled 
an average of $12.2 \%$ more voxels and always resulted in fewer voxels computed by the rasterizer and the 
pixel shader. The measurements also suggest that larger scenes with more voxels lead to a higher culling 
efficiency. This seems plausible, as a higher voxel number tends to result in a higher number of best occluders 
for a static amount of voxels per octree node. As the \emph{Hairball} scene shows, the algorithm works in favor 
of large, tight geometry and is challenged by smaller details, large empty spaces, and holes.

\subsection{CPU Performance} \label{subsec-cou-performance}

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Average \ac{CPU} performance using different occlusion culling configurations.}

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:cpu-performance}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent
The average \ac{CPU} time over the course of a standardized test animation using our implementation is 
shown in Fig.~\ref{tab:cpu-performance}. It was measured for each scene and combined to a total 
average value using an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X \ac{CPU}. This was done for each culling configuration to 
evaluate the difference in runtime performance for the \emph{Update()} and \emph{Render} functions 
of the application. \\

\noindent
The table shows that the average \ac{CPU} performance does not change significantly between the different 
culling configurations. This is due to the \ac{GPU}-driven nature of the algorithm, which results in a 
low memory bandwidth between \ac{CPU} and \ac{GPU}. Most of the work is executed on the \ac{GPU} and the \ac{CPU} 
implementations do not change considerably between the per-octree node occlusion culling and the 
per-meshlet occlusion culling configuration. \\

\noindent
The small changes that are visible in the \emph{Render()} function measurements are attributed to 
the \ac{GPU} performance differences presented below. The changes in the \emph{Update()} function 
measurements cannot be reliably attributed to any change in the pipeline setup.

\subsection{GPU Performance} \label{subsec-gpu-performance}

\noindent
The \ac{GPU} performance shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gpu-performance-full} was measured on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 
for each scene and each culling configuration. The average measurements indicate a significant performance 
increase in every scenario. The greatest average increase was measured using the \emph{Bunny} scene, which 
featured a large volume and a high number of voxels. Those characteristics seem to work in favor of the 
algorithm, as a large volume and a high voxel count result in an efficient approximation of the given scene. 
Best occluders can potentially be computed more efficiently, since a lot of adjacent octree nodes are expected 
to be full. \\

\noindent
A closer inspection of the individual pipeline stages found that the depth prepass is more or less static in 
computation time for both configurations, as it scales with the screen resolution, which was set to a fixed 
resolution of $1280 \times 900$ for all measurements. This means that the overhead of the algorithm scales 
with screen resolution and the number of the best occluders drawn during the prepass. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:gpu-performance-prepass} shows that both tested configurations perform similarly during the 
depth prepass and that both the copy and the generation of the \ac{HZB} are relatively static in this testing 
scenario. Only the drawing of the best occluders varies significantly for different scenes, as the amount of 
best occluders changes from one scene to another. \\

\noindent
The most significant differences in performance originate from the main draw pass, which includes the task shader, 
the mesh shader, the rasterizer, and the pixel shader. The culling of voxels leads to a lower computational 
load on those pipeline stages, which in turn considerably reduces the overall render time. The data shows that the 
performance gains outweigh the overhead introduced by the occlusion culling in all tested cases.  

\subsection{Overdraw} \label{subsec-overdraw}

\noindent
Analyzing the overdraw for each scene helps to understand where unnecessary pixel shader 
invocations occur. We tested different angles for each scene and recorded overdraw of individual 
pixels using no occlusion culling, the per-octree occlusion culling, and the per-meshlet occlusion 
culling configuration. Fig.~\ref{fig:overdraw} shows an exemplary overdraw visualization for the 
\emph{Bunny} scene. \\

\end{figure}


\noindent
Image (a) shows that no culling results in a lot of overdraw for some camera angles tested. (b) shows 
the per-octree occlusion culling, which features less overdraw overall but still a visible outline 
for the voxels that were not culled by the best occluders. (c) shows the per-meshlet occlusion culling 
configuration, which was able to reduce overdraw considerably as compared to (a) and (b). The outline 
of the scene is smaller and not as heavily overdrawn as the outline in (b), which is attributed to the 
more granular culling of voxels, even within otherwise visible octree nodes. (d) shows the difference 
between (b) and (c), which clearly indicates that the visible surface of the scene can be better 
optimized in terms of overdraw when using per-meshlet occlusion culling. \\

\noindent
Different angles lead to less overdraw and lower differences between all configurations. Nevertheless, 
in all cases the per-meshlet occlusion culling configuration was able to reduce overdraw at least to a 
considerable degree.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec-conclusion}

\noindent
We have shown that the \ac{HZB} algorithm can be adapted for efficient and dynamic use in rasterized, voxel-based 
volumetric rendering. An approach has been presented that makes use of an octree data structure to approximate 
the scenes invisible voxel data and subsequently uses this data to efficiently draw the best occluders for occlusion 
culling. \\

\noindent
We compared two similar culling configurations within the \ac{HZB} approach and showed that the use of the 
modern mesh shading pipeline considerably increases culling efficiency and, ultimately, overall performance.
The increase in performance compared to the base pipeline without occlusion culling ranged from $61.3 \%$ for 
the \emph{Hairball} scene up to $90.7 \%$ for the \emph{Bunny} scene. The measurements showed that the modern 
mesh shading pipeline allows for a more granular culling of voxels and outperforms the compared per-octree 
node occlusion culling by an average of $29 \%$ in terms of time spent on the \ac{GPU}. \\

\noindent
We conclude that the algorithm can successfully be applied to dense voxel scenes, which feature large, dense 
geometry. In contrast, scenes featuring fine, thin details, holes, or large areas without any geometry are 
generally challenging for the algorithm. \\

\noindent
Our approach can be used to greatly increase performance for suitable scenes while preserving a manageable 
overhead. In addition, it can be used for dynamically changing scenes since the best occluders can be 
determined during runtime, instead of being manually picked beforehand.

\section{Future Work} \label{sec-future-work}

\noindent
The dynamic update needs to be tested thoroughly to evaluate the capability of the algorithm to handle updating 
larger scenes while also providing reasonable budget for other \ac{CPU} operations. The determination of the best 
occluders could potentially be optimized further by introducing multi-threading. One approach might be to 
compute the best occluders for the first eight child nodes in the hierarchy in parallel and to combine the results 
afterwards. \\

\noindent
Furthermore, the \ac{HZB} approach can potentially be omitted since the per-meshlet culling might be able to 
rely on only sampling the full-resolution depth buffer at the voxels minimum and maximum boundaries directly, 
instead of traversing the whole hierarchy. Because the voxel scenes do not have sub-voxel detail, this could 
potentially result in correct occlusion culling without the overhead of computing the depth hierarchy, which 
in turn would also reduce the memory footprint of the algorithm. This assumption would be an interesting 
subject for future work. \\

\noindent
Finally, the spatial data structure can potentially be used to implicitly encode the voxel position. This way, 
a separate buffer would be made redundant, and the bandwidth as well as the capabilities for dynamically updating the 
data could be improved further. Implementing and testing different ways of storing the data would be another 
direction for future work.
